## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
The database schema is automatically set up through Supabase migrations:
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. The migrations will be applied automatically
3. Enable real-time for the required tables

### 2. Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Model Setup
The AI detection models are automatically downloaded when you first use the detection features:
- COCO-SSD (27MB) - High accuracy general purpose detection
- MobileNet-SSD (10MB) - Fast lightweight detection

Models are cached locally for offline use.

## Usage

### Authentication
The system includes demo credentials for testing:
- **Admin**: admin@simhastha.org / admin123
- **Police**: police@simhastha.org / police123
- **Volunteer**: volunteer@simhastha.org / volunteer123

### Detection System
1. Navigate to the "Detection" tab
2. Load AI models using the Model Manager
3. Select a zone and choose input source (camera/video/image)
4. Define Region of Interest (ROI) by drawing or using sliders
5. Start detection to begin real-time people counting
6. Results are automatically saved to the database and broadcast in real-time

### Map Monitoring
1. Go to the "Map" tab
2. Toggle heatmap overlay to see real-time crowd density
3. Enable evacuation routes to see AI-recommended paths
4. Use flow indicators to visualize crowd movement
5. Click on zones for detailed information and status

### Alert Management
1. Visit the "Alerts" tab
2. View smart alerts categorized by type and priority
3. Acknowledge alerts with role-based permissions
4. System automatically generates AI-powered alerts
5. Receive browser and sound notifications for critical alerts

## Architecture

### People Detection
